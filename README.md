## Overview

The Motivational Quotes API provides a scalable and accessible way to deliver daily motivational quotes. It supports filtering, searching, and generating AI-powered explanations for quotes. The API is intended to be used as a backend service for mobile apps, websites, or any application that requires daily inspirational content.

## Features

- **Filter & Search:** Filter quotes by year, author, or category, and search by keywords.
- **AI Explanations:** Generate human-like explanations for quotes using OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Built using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for a scalable and cost-effective solution.
- **Easy Deployment:** Managed via the Serverless Framework for rapid deployment and updates.

## Architecture

- **AWS Lambda:** Hosts Python functions that implement your API endpoints.
- **API Gateway:** Exposes your Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints.
- **DynamoDB:** Stores motivational quotes with fields such as `quote_id`, `quote_text`, `author`, `year`, and optionally `category`.
- **OpenAI API:** Powers the AI explanation functionality.
- **Serverless Framework:** Handles the packaging, deployment, and management of the API and its resources.
